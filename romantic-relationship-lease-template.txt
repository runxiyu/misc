Subject: Lease request for romantic relationship

I could like to request a lease for a romantic relationship with you.
The time-to-live shall be 30 days. The lease may be renewed in the last
5 days. If the lease expires without renewal, then pretend that none of
this has ever happened.

Best regards,
